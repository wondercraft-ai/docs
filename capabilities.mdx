**The Wondercraft API lets you perform four broad intents:**

1. Create a natural podcast with 2 hosts using Convo Mode, [using AI to generate a script](/api-reference/endpoint/convo_mode_ai_scripted)
2. Create a natural podcast with 2 hosts using Convo Mode, [with a user provided script](/api-reference/endpoint/convo_mode_user_scripted)
3. Create any other audio content (audio ads, podcasts with more or less than 2 speakers, meditations, audiobooks), [using AI to generate a script](/api-reference/endpoint/generate_podcast)
4. Create any other audio content, [with a user provided script](/api-reference/endpoint/user_scripted)


**For these actions, the API supports the ability to:**

- Choose which voices you want to use
    - Retrieve the voiceID’s from the studio, including any voice clones and custom voices
    - Otherwise, default voices will be used
- Add music and control its playback *(Not supported by the two Convo Mode podcast endpoints)*
    - Choose your clip and retrieve the musicID from the studio
    - Add a fade in and out for a set duration of time
    - Set when the music playback should start and end
    - Control the volume of the music clip
- Add ‘Delivery Instructions’ prompt on how you want the dialogue to delivered *(Only supported by the two Convo Mode podcast endpoints)*
    - Specify things like tone, accent, pace, the vibe between the two speakers

**The API does not currently support the following capabilities. Please use the Wondercraft Studio to achieve these functionalities:**

- Adding sound effects
- Performing timeline controls on voice, such as speed, splitting, trimming, adding or removing pauses, volume and duplication
- Uploading your own audio clips and music
- Iteratively editing from a draft or starting point
