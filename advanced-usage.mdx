description: "Start customizing voices and background music via the API"
---

This section will guide will show you how to use Python to customize the generated audio with background music and different voices.
For any details about the API, please refer to the [API Reference](/api-reference).

<Warning>
  This API is under rapid development. We are working hard to improve existing
  functionality and add missing functionality and as such might need to drop
  support for existing workflows. If you have any feature requests or concerns,
  please contact support@wondercraft.ai
</Warning>

## Using your own script

If you would prefer to provide your own script, you can use the `/podcast/scripted` endpoint instead. The payload for that request
looks slightly different. You will provide script segemnts, where each segment contains the text and the voice id for the
speaker.

```python
API_BASE_URL = 'https://api.wondercraft.ai/v1'
headers = {
    'x-api-key': API_KEY
}

voice_id_1 = "<voice_id_1>"
voice_id_2 = "<voice_id_2>"

script_payload = {
    "script": [
        {"text": "This is the first speaker", "voice_id": voice_id_1},
        {"text": "And this the second speaker", "voice_id": voice_id_2},
        {"text": "This is the first speaker again", "voice_id": voice_id_1},
        {"text": "The first speaker likes to talk alot", "voice_id": voice_id_2},
        {"text": "ha ha ha... ok I do", "voice_id": voice_id_1},
    ]
}

response = requests.post(API_BASE_URL + "/podcast/scripted", json=script_payload, headers=headers)
```

Voice IDs can be copied from the Wondercraft platform:

## Adding background music

This guide explains how to use the `music_spec` field in the `GenerateAiScriptedEpisodeRequest` to add
background music to podcast episodes.

The `music_spec` field is an optional component of the requests to `/podcast` and `/podcast/scripted`
that allows you to add a background music track to the generated podcast.
This field uses the `MusicTrackSpec` model, which provides fine-grained control over the music playback.

### Example music_spec Configuration

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the music_spec field:

```json
{
  "music_spec": {
    "music_id": "12345",
    "fade_in_ms": 3000,
    "fade_out_ms": 2000,
    "playback_start": 5000,
    "playback_end": 30000
  }
}
```

### Parameters in MusicTrackSpec

1. `music_id` (Required)
   - Description: The unique ID of the music track to use as background.
   - Where to find it: Obtain the music_id from the Wondercraft platform.
   - Example: "music_id": "12345"
2. `fade_in_ms` (Optional)
   - Description: Specifies the duration (in milliseconds) for the music to fade in at the start.
   - Default: 0 (no fade-in).
   - Example: `"fade_in_ms": 3000` fades in the music over the first 3 seconds.
3. `fade_out_ms` (Optional)
   - Description: Specifies the duration (in milliseconds) for the music to fade out at the end.
   - Default: 0 (no fade-out).
   - Example: `"fade_out_ms": 2000` fades out the music over the last 2 seconds.
4. `playback_start` (Optional)
   - Description: The starting point (in milliseconds) of the music track to begin playback. This trims the beginning of the music track.
   - Default: 0 (play from the beginning).
   - Example: `"playback_start": 5000` starts the playback 5 seconds into the music track.
5. `playback_end` (Optional)
   - Description: The point (in milliseconds) at which the music track stops playing. This trims the end of the music track.
   - Default: Plays until the end of the music track or the length of the generated episode (whichever comes first).
   - Example: "playback_end": 30000 stops playback 30 seconds into the music track.

### Additional Notes

1. Automatic Trimming: The music track is automatically trimmed to match the duration of the generated podcast episode. If the episode is shorter than the music track, playback stops at the episode's end.

2. Music Placement: The music always starts at the beginning of the podcast and cannot be placed at other positions.

3. Dependencies: The music_spec field is optional. If omitted, no background music will be added.

4. Validation: Ensure the music_id is valid and that fade_in_ms, fade_out_ms, playback_start, and playback_end are within the bounds of the music track's duration.

Example Full Request

```json
{
  "prompt": "In this episode, we discuss the future of AI and its impact on the job market.",
  "voice_ids": ["voice_1", "voice_2"],
  "music_spec": {
    "music_id": "c6a490a3-f404-4525-955b-e0baddeafb99",
    "fade_in_ms": 3000,
    "fade_out_ms": 2000,
    "playback_start": 0,
    "playback_end": 10000
  }
}
```

This request:

- Adds background music with ID "c6a490a3-f404-4525-955b-e0baddeafb99".
- Fades in over 3 seconds, starts playback at the beginning of the track, and fades out over 2 seconds.
- Stops playback 10 seconds into the music or at the end of the podcast, whichever comes first.
