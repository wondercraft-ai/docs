## Authentication

To create an engaging podcast, you'll need to get yourself an API key, which you can do by logging into Wondercraft or creating an account if you don't already have one.
Please note, you'll need to be on a paid plan to access the API.

You can create a new key by clicking on the user avater in the bottom left corner and selecting "API Keys". There, you will be able to create a new key which you can use to authenticate your requests.

The API key should be passed in the header of your requests as `X-API-KEY`.
