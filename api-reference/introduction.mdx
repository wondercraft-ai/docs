## Authentication

To create audio content, you'll need to get yourself an API key, which you can do by logging into Wondercraft or creating an account if you don't already have one.
Please note, you'll need to be on a paid plan to access the API.

You can create a new key by clicking on "My Workspace" in the top right of the side bar and selecting "API Keys". There, you will be able to create a new key which you can use to authenticate your requests.

The API key should be passed in the header of your requests as `X-API-KEY`.

## Base URL

The base URL for all requests is `https://api.wondercraft.ai/v1`.

## Rate limits

Please note, there is currently a limit of 5 concurrent jobs. If you need to increase this, please contact support@wondercraft.ai.
