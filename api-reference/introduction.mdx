Discover how to create podcasts, audio ads, meditations and audiobooks using the Wondercraft API.

Create an AI-generated podcast with two hosts using Convo Mode, or create an audio ad from prompt to full spec. Visit the [Capabilities](/capabilities) page to get a better understanding of what you can can do using the API. You can expect 1 min of generated audio to cost roughly 10 credits.

Otherwise, just head to the [Quickstart](/Quickstart) page to get started.

## Authentication

To create audio content, you'll need to get yourself an API key, which you can do by logging into Wondercraft or creating an account if you don't already have one.
Please note, you'll need to be on a paid plan to access the API.

You can create a new key by navigating to the workspace selector (on the top left of the platform) > Workspace Settings > API keys. There, you will be able to create a new key which you can use to authenticate your requests.

The API key should be passed in the header of your requests as `X-API-KEY`.

## Base URL

The base URL for all requests is `https://api.wondercraft.ai/v1`.

## Rate limits

Please note, there is currently a limit of 5 concurrent jobs. If you need to increase this, please contact support@wondercraft.ai.
